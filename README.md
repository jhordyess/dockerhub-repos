# My docker hub images

Welcome to my collection of Docker images tailored for [Visual Studio Code Development Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). These images are equipped with essential tools like **Zsh**, **Git**, and a non-root user named `jhordyess`.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting with Dev Containers, these images aim to simplify your workflow.

## Description

Each image includes the following components:

- [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org/): A powerful and user-friendly shell.
- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/): A delightful community-driven framework for managing Zsh configurations.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): An industry-standard version control system.
- Non-root User: The images come with a non-root user named `jhordyess` to enhance security and manage permissions effectively.

You can find all these images conveniently hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

## Usage

To use these images, you must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your computer. Then, you can use the following command to download the image:

```bash
docker pull jhordyess/<image>:<version>
```

For example, to download the Ubuntu 24.04 image, you can use the following command:

```bash
docker pull jhordyess/ubuntu:24.04
```
